### Rerendering Notes

Markdown note files are located in the `content/` directory, separated by year and module. The rendered HTML notes are located in the `notes/` directory. Building requires [Tatum](https://github.com/BlueTot/tatum), Node.js, and GNU Make.

From the repository root, rebuild the complete website with:

```bash
make clean && make build
```

`make clean` removes the generated HTML files listed in `.tatum/render-list.json` and the generated `structure.json`. `make build` then renders all notes with the `.tatum/bluetot` template and regenerates the directory structure. Cleaning first prevents Tatum from prompting before overwriting each existing page.

To remove the generated files without rebuilding them, run:

```bash
make clean
```

The cleanup script validates that every render target is an HTML file under `notes/`; it does not delete unlisted files. To inspect what it would remove without changing anything, run:

```bash
node scripts/clean-generated.js --dry-run
```

Without Make, the equivalent manual workflow is:

```bash
node scripts/clean-generated.js
tatum render-all --template .tatum/bluetot -p
node scripts/update-dir-structure.js
```

### GitHub Pages deployment

Generated pages in `notes/` and the generated `structure.json` are ignored by Git. A pull request targeting `main` runs `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to clean and build the site. The build result appears as the `build` check on the PR, and the `pr-site` artifact can be downloaded from the workflow run. PRs do not deploy. A push to `main` runs the same build and deploys the resulting site as a GitHub Pages artifact. The workflow can also be started manually from the repository's **Actions** tab.

In the GitHub repository settings, set **Pages > Build and deployment > Source** to **GitHub Actions**. Build and deployment results are shown in the repository's **Actions** tab. To require the build before merging, add the `build` job as a required status check in the protection rules for `main`.

### Adding a markdown file

To render a new markdown file, add a line to `.tatum/render-list.json` in the format `"<markdown path>": "<html path>`. For example:

```json
"content/year2/cs275/notes.md": "notes/year2/cs275/cs275-revision-notes.html"
```
